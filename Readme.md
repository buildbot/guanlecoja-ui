Declare a group in the menu. takes on object with the following attributes:

* `name`: Name of the menu, identifier for reference in menu items
* `caption`: Text of the menu, as shown in the UI
* `icon`: Icon name from font-awesome. E.g `bug` will use the `fa-bug` class for the icon
* `order`: The menu is reordered according to this key. This allows to declare menus in different modules, without caring about the module load order.

#### `glMenuServiceProvider.setDefaultGroup(group)`

#### `$stateProvider.state(state)`

Menu items are defined in `$stateProvider.state`'s data. glMenuService scans the list of states to find the menu items. You can use `state.data` for the usage you want, but glMenuService will look at the following attributes:

* `group`: name of the group to which append this menu-item
* `caption`: text of the menu-item

### glBreadcrumbService

Set the breadcrumbs of glTopMenu. In some cases, the automated breadcrumb from glTopMenu is unsuitable. In this case, you can use glBreadcrumbService to override it.

* `caption`: text of the breadcrumb item
* `href`: optional href for the breadcrumb

Dont put both `sref` and `href` argument, this does not make sense and is not supported.

## ChangeLog

* 2.0.0: This package is not maintained for use outside Buildbot.
         Rewrite the package from CoffeeScript to plain JavaScript.
* 1.8.0: body is no more height:100%, in order to make full height page, user need to use height: 100vh.
         left-bar pinned preference is now stored in the browser.
* 1.7.0: topbar is now responsive. It will collapse on mobile.
* 1.6.3: Adds setDefaultGroup(group) to glMenuServiceProvider. This option allows to expand a menu by default
* 1.6.2: Fix width issues of content which push some content off-screen for certain monitor size
* 1.6.1: rebuilt with guanlecoja 1.7.2, which populates the BOWERDEPS metadata
* 1.6.0: Massive upgrade of dependencies:
    - jquery 2.1 -> 2.2.
    - Angular 1.4 -> 1.5.
    - Lodash -> 4.11.
    - Drop underscore.string as lodash got most important string utils.
    - angular-ui-bootstrap 0.11 -> 1.3.2:
        Most important change is that ui-bootstrap directives are now prefixed with "uib-" e.g: in jade: ".dropdown-toggle" -> ".dropdown-toggle(uib-dropdown-toggle)"
        This makes the markup more complicated, but the old 0.11 documentation is not even available anymore, so its best to upgrade.
* 1.5.0: Switch to angularJS 1.4.3
* 1.4.2: fix the sidebar when screen is > 800px
* 1.4.1: bump ui-router version to 0.2.13
* 1.4.0: add topbar-contextual-actions directive and associated service
* 1.3.1: Fix auto scrollbar on sidebar menu
* 1.3.0: Switch to angularJS 1.3.1
* 1.2.3: Initial Release
